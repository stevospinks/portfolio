I chose to develop the system using C++ and OpenGL in Visual Studio 2010. I decided to demonstrate cloth and added natural forces such as gravity and wind. A simple collision detection function was also included. Information about all three stages in this project can be found in the documentation. The video below shows a demonstration of the final application",
